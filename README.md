# JS13K-Disconnected
A JS13K Competition Entry Game. Absolute Work-in-progress.

## Why webpack, why seperate stylesheet, why import css into the js? It doesn't make sense!
All of that has been done solely to ease the development experience by as much as possible.
If you are like me, you do not like to have to refresh things everytime you make changes to your code.

Hence, everything (but the images) refreshes by itself as long as webpack dev server is running, making the process smooth and painless.
Compression and minification is there to give you a preview of what is the approximate zip size as of now. In reality, it will get smaller than that by a notch.


Do note, that this is absolutely not the final state of things.
In the end, everything will be manually put through appropriate minifiers and compressors (Closure, tinypng, JSCrush / Packer) , to reduce the size to the minimum.
